# Meeting_2

### 1. Introduction to Arduino 2
- Developing knowledge in Arduino

### 2. Project to Do
- S.O.S Distress Signal: the international Morse code distress signal
  - S.O.S Signal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETGq7sqytE
  - Build a circuit with 3 LEDs
  - Make the first LED blink for 3 times with 1 second pause; in the mean time, turn off other LEDs
  - Make the second LED blink for 3 times with 2 seconds pause; in the mean time, turn off other LEDs
  - Make the third LED blink for 3 times with 1 second pause; in the mean time, turn off other LEDs

### 3. Goals
- Review about Arduino I/O
- Review about how to use a breadboard
- Learn to build a circuit with 3 LEDs on a breadboard, and connect them to a Arduino Uno
- Review about the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
- Learn to write programs to power the circuit to present the S.O.S Distress Signal.
